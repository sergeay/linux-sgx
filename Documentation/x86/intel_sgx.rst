Intel(R) SGX driver
===================

Introduction
============

Intel(R) SGX is a set of CPU instructions that can be used by applications to
set aside private regions of code and data. The code outside the enclave is
disallowed to access the memory inside the enclave by the CPU access control.
In a way you can think that SGX provides inverted sandbox. It protects the
application from a malicious host.

You can tell if your CPU supports SGX by looking into ``/proc/cpuinfo``:

	``cat /proc/cpuinfo  | grep sgx``

Overview of SGX
===============

SGX has a set of data structures to maintain information about the enclaves and
their security properties. BIOS reserves a fixed size region of physical memory
for these structures by setting Processor Reserved Memory Range Registers
(PRMRR).

This memory range is protected from outside access by the CPU and all the data
coming in and out of the CPU package is encrypted by a key that is generated for
each boot cycle.

Enclaves execute in ring-3 in a special enclave submode using pages from the
reserved memory range. A fixed logical address range for the enclave is reserved
by ENCLS(ECREATE), a leaf instruction used to create enclaves. It is referred in
the documentation commonly as the ELRANGE.

Every memory access to the ELRANGE is asserted by the CPU. If the CPU is not
executing in the enclave mode inside the enclave, #GP is raised. On the other
hand enclave code can make memory accesses both inside and outside of the
ELRANGE.

Enclave can only execute code inside the ELRANGE. Instructions that may cause
VMEXIT, IO instructions and instructions that require a privilege change are
prohibited inside the enclave. Interrupts and exceptions always cause enclave
to exit and jump to an address outside the enclave given when the enclave is
entered by using the leaf instruction ENCLS(EENTER).

Data types
----------

The protected memory range contains the following data:

* **Enclave Page Cache (EPC):** protected pages
* **Enclave Page Cache Map (EPCM):** a database that describes the state of the
  pages and link them to an enclave.

EPC has a number of different types of pages:

* **SGX Enclave Control Structure (SECS)**: describes the global
  properties of an enclave.
* **Regular (REG):** code and data pages in the ELRANGE.
* **Thread Control Structure (TCS):** pages that define entry points inside an
  enclave. The enclave can only be entered through these entry points and each
  can host a single hardware thread at a time.
* **Version Array (VA)**: 64-bit version numbers for pages that have been
  swapped outside the enclave. Each page contains 512 version numbers.

Launch control
--------------

To launch an enclave, two structures must be provided for ENCLS(EINIT):

1. **SIGSTRUCT:** signed measurement of the enclave binary.
2. **EINITTOKEN:** a cryptographic token CMAC-signed with a AES256-key called
   *launch key*, which is re-generated for each boot cycle.

The CPU holds a SHA256 hash of a 3072-bit RSA public key inside
IA32_SGXLEPUBKEYHASHn MSRs. Enclaves with a SIGSTRUCT that is signed with this
key do not require a valid EINITTOKEN and can be authorized with special
privileges. One of those privileges is ability to acquire the launch key with
ENCLS(EGETKEY).

**IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL[17]** is used by the BIOS configure whether
IA32_SGXLEPUBKEYHASH MSRs are read-only or read-write before locking the
feature control register and handing over control to the operating system.

Enclave construction
--------------------

The construction is started by filling out the SECS that contains enclave
address range, privileged attributes and measurement of TCS and REG pages (pages
that will be mapped to the address range) among the other things. This structure
is passed out to the ENCLS(ECREATE) together with a physical address of a page
in EPC that will hold the SECS.

The pages are added with ENCLS(EADD) and measured with ENCLS(EEXTEND) i.e.
SHA256 hash MRENCLAVE residing in the SECS is extended with the page data.

After all of the pages have been added, the enclave is initialized with
ENCLS(EINIT). ENCLS(INIT) checks that the SIGSTRUCT is signed with the contained
public key. If the given EINITTOKEN has the valid bit set, the CPU checks that
the token is valid (CMAC'd with the launch key). If the token is not valid,
the CPU will check whether the enclave is signed with a key matching to the
IA32_SGXLEPUBKEYHASHn MSRs.

Swapping pages
--------------

Enclave pages can be swapped out with ENCLS(EWB) to the unprotected memory. In
addition to the EPC page, ENCLS(EWB) takes in a VA page and address for PCMD
structure (Page Crypto MetaData) as input. The VA page will seal a version
number for the page. PCMD is 128 byte structure that contains tracking
information for the page, most importantly its MAC. With these structures the
enclave is sealed and rollback protected while it resides in the unprotected
memory.

Before the page can be swapped out it must not have any active TLB references.
ENCLS(EBLOCK) instruction moves a page to the *blocked* state, which means
that no new TLB entries can be created to it by the hardware threads.

After this a shootdown sequence is started with ENCLS(ETRACK), which sets an
increased counter value to the entering hardware threads. ENCLS(EWB) will
return SGX_NOT_TRACKED error while there are still threads with the earlier
couner value because that means that there might be hardware thread inside
the enclave with TLB entries to pages that are to be swapped.

Kernel internals
================

Requirements
------------

Because SGX has an ever evolving and expanding feature set, it's possible for
a BIOS or VMM to configure a system in such a way that not all CPUs are equal,
e.g. where Launch Control is only enabled on a subset of CPUs.  Linux does
*not* support such a heterogeneous system configuration, nor does it even
attempt to play nice in the face of a misconfigured system.  With the exception
of Launch Control's hash MSRs, which can vary per CPU, Linux assumes that all
CPUs have a configuration that is identical to the boot CPU.


Roles and responsibilities
--------------------------

SGX introduces system resources, e.g. EPC memory, that must be accessible to
multiple entities, e.g. the native kernel driver (to expose SGX to userspace)
and KVM (to expose SGX to VMs), ideally without introducing any dependencies
between each SGX entity.  To that end, the kernel owns and manages the shared
system resources, i.e. the EPC and Launch Control MSRs, and defines functions
that provide appropriate access to the shared resources.  SGX support for
user space and VMs is left to the SGX platform driver and KVM respectively.

Launching enclaves
------------------

The current kernel implementation supports only unlocked MSRs i.e.
FEATURE_CONTROL_SGX_LE_WR must be set. The launch is performed by setting the
MSRs to the hash of the public key modulus of the enclave signer, which is one
f the fields in the SIGSTRUCT.

EPC management
--------------

Due to the unique requirements for swapping EPC pages, and because EPC pages
(currently) do not have associated page structures, management of the EPC is
not handled by the standard Linux swapper.  SGX directly handles swapping
of EPC pages, including a kthread to initiate reclaim and a rudimentary LRU
mechanism. The consumers of EPC pages, e.g. the SGX driver, are required to
implement function callbacks that can be invoked by the kernel to age,
swap, and/or forcefully reclaim a target EPC page.  In effect, the kernel
controls what happens and when, while the consumers (driver, KVM, etc..) do
the actual work.
